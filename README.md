# ICON OF SIN
### Prototype

Date: 2020/04/20

## DESCRIPTION

This is a project with objective to be a "Test Chamber" for a library that I created for the company 'Certsys'.
In that scope, this library should be a simple 2D graphics engine used to enhance the user experience with HTML5 Canvas when working with Angular frontends.

In this specific project I had the idea to recreate "Icon of Sin" ending of the video-game Doom 2, as a type of tribute.

P.S: This project is incomplete because the objective of it is only serve as test chamber for enhancements created for a propertary external library. It's impossible rebuild the project without access to that dependency, so in reason of that i've commited (inside bin folder) an "transpiled" version of it.


## HELP

Put the contents of the folder "bin" inside the root of a http server (Like apache, nginx e etc) and run through your browser.
